# Shopee Analytics

##### My attempt at creating a data platform based on data collected from a Singaporean e-commerce company called Shopee.

# Shopee

##### Shopee Pte. Ltd. is a Singaporean multinational technology company that specialises in e-commerce. They are currently the biggest e-commerce platform in Southeast Asia. As such, the platform is filled with data that could be used for many purposes including market research, education, or creating a sample database for machine learning projects. 

# Why Shopee

##### Shopee has an easily accesible API from which an external user (like me), can obtain detailed data including but not limited to:
- Vendors 
- What products they sell
- How many of those products they have sold
- The products' prices
- Their ratings

##### All of this data and more is available publicly, so Shopee is nothing but a goldmine of data.
